#  Creating a Flutter App
See below note to create a flutter project
#  Step 1: Create a New Project

```bash
flutter create <project_name>
```

This generates a complete Flutter project with default files and folders.


#  Step 2: Start an Emulator

1. Press `Command + Shift + P` to open the **Command Palette**.
2. Type `Flutter: Launch Emulator`.
3. Select and start an **iOS emulator** (or Android if preferred).

Alternatively, you can launch the emulator from Android Studio or VS Code sidebar.


#  Step 3: Run the App
Below are some methods to run the app:
##  Method 1: VS Code

* Go to **Run > Run Without Debugging** or press `Option + F5`.

##  Method 2: Terminal

```bash
flutter run
```

Make sure your emulator/device is running.


#  Flutter Run - Key Commands

| Command | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `r`     | Hot Reload – injects updated code without restarting the app |
| `R`     | Hot Restart – restarts the app with preserved state          |
| `h`     | Show list of available interactive commands                  |
| `d`     | Detach – keeps app running but stops terminal connection     |
| `c`     | Clear the terminal screen                                    |


#  Flutter Basics

In Flutter, **everything is a widget** – from UI elements to layout structures.


#  Minimal Flutter App Setup

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

# Create a Stateless Widget using `stl` snippet

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

`MaterialApp` provides core functionality like navigation, theming, and routing.


#  Summary

* Use `flutter create` to scaffold a new project.
* Launch emulator and run your app via VS Code or terminal.
* Hot reload (`r`) is your best friend during UI development.
* Everything in Flutter is a widget – start by mastering `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`.
