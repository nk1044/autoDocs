# Trie
A **Trie** is a specialized tree-like data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. It excels in tasks involving **prefix matching**, such as **autocomplete**, **spell checking**, **word filtering**, and **IP routing**.

# What is a Trie?

A Trie (also known as a **prefix tree**) allows you to:

* Insert words
* Search for exact words
* Search for words that start with a given prefix

Each node in the Trie represents a **single character**, and nodes are connected in a way that characters form strings along a path.


# Structure of a Trie

* The **root node** doesn't store any character and acts as the starting point.
* Each node can have **up to 26 children** (one for each lowercase English letter).
* Nodes contain:

  * A fixed-size **array/vector of child pointers** (for 'a' to 'z')
  * A **flag** (`isEndOfWord`) to indicate the end of a valid word


# Trie Node Definition

```cpp
class Node {
private:
    vector<Node*> links;  // Stores references to child nodes (26 letters)
    bool flag;            // Marks if the node is the end of a word

public:
    // Constructor: initializes 26 child pointers to nullptr and flag to false
    Node() {
        links.resize(26, nullptr);
        flag = false;
    }

    // Checks if a node has a link for the given character
    bool containsKey(char ch) {
        return links[ch - 'a'] != nullptr;
    }

    // Creates a new node for the given character
    void addKey(char ch) {
        links[ch - 'a'] = new Node();
    }

    // Returns the child node associated with the given character
    Node* getKey(char ch) {
        return links[ch - 'a'];
    }

    // Marks the current node as the end of a word
    void setEnd() {
        flag = true;
    }

    // Checks if the current node is the end of a word
    bool isEnd() {
        return flag;
    }
};
```


# Trie Implementation

```cpp
class Trie {
private:
    Node* root;  // Root of the trie

public:
    // Constructor: initializes the root node
    Trie() {
        root = new Node();
    }

    // Inserts a word into the trie
    void insert(string word) {
        if (word.empty()) return;
        Node* node = root;

        for (char ch : word) {
            // If the path for the character doesn't exist, create it
            if (!node->containsKey(ch)) {
                node->addKey(ch);
            }
            // Move to the next node
            node = node->getKey(ch);
        }

        // After inserting all characters, mark the last node as the end of a word
        node->setEnd();
    }

    // Searches for a full word in the trie
    bool search(string word) {
        Node* node = root;

        for (char ch : word) {
            // If path breaks, the word doesn't exist
            if (!node || !node->containsKey(ch)) return false;
            node = node->getKey(ch);
        }

        // Return true only if the word ends at this node
        return node->isEnd();
    }

    // Checks if there exists any word in the trie that starts with the given prefix
    bool startsWith(string prefix) {
        Node* node = root;

        for (char ch : prefix) {
            if (!node || !node->containsKey(ch)) return false;
            node = node->getKey(ch);
        }

        // Reaching here means the prefix is valid
        return true;
    }
};
```

# Key Properties

* **Prefix Sharing**: All words with a common prefix share the same path in the trie.
* **Alphabet Size**: The number of children per node depends on the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase English).
* **No Duplicates**: Inserting the same word multiple times doesn’t create duplicates.


# Common Operations

1. **Insert**: Add a word character by character, creating nodes as needed.
2. **Search**: Traverse the trie to check if a full word exists and ends correctly.
3. **StartsWith**: Similar to search, but doesn't require the last node to mark the end of a word.
4. **Delete** *(not shown here)*: Unmark end nodes and remove unnecessary child links recursively.


# Time and Space Complexity

| Operation    | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Insert       | O(L)            | O(ALPHABET × N)  |
| Search       | O(L)            | -                |
| Prefix check | O(L)            | -                |

* `L`: Length of the input word
* `ALPHABET`: Size of character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase a-z)
* `N`: Total number of nodes created


# Use Cases

* **Autocomplete systems**
* **Spell checkers**
* **Search engines (prefix match)**
* **Word games (e.g., Boggle, Scrabble)**
* **IP routing (binary trie variants)**


# Variants

* **Compressed Trie (Radix Tree)**: Combines nodes with single children into one, reducing memory usage.
* **Suffix Trie**: Stores all suffixes of a word, allowing fast substring queries.
* **Ternary Search Trie**: Each node has 3 children (less, equal, greater); saves space but more complex to implement.


# Limitations

* **Memory-Intensive**: Due to pointer arrays in each node, tries can use significant memory for large datasets.
* **Less Efficient for Small Data**: For short or few strings, a hash map or set may be faster and more space-efficient.
