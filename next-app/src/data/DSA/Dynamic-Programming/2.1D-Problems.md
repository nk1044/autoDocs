#  1D Dynamic Programming Problems

1D DP problems involve solving problems where the state can be represented using a single variable, usually an index or a value.

#  Recognizing a Dynamic Programming Problem

A problem is likely to be solvable using DP if:

*  You're asked to **count the number of ways** to reach a goal.
*  You're asked to find the **minimum or maximum** value to achieve a goal.
*  You must try **all possible ways/choices** and select the best.
*  The solution can be defined in terms of **recurrence (overlapping subproblems)**.
*  The brute-force or recursive solution has **repeating subproblems**.

#  How to Approach a DP Problem

1. **Define the State:**

* Choose a parameter (usually index, value, etc.) that represents a subproblem.
* Example: `dp[i]` might represent the minimum cost to reach step `i`.

2. **Identify the Base Case:**

* What is the result of the smallest input?
* Example: `dp[0] = 0`, `dp[1] = 1`, etc.

3. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**

* What decisions can you make at each step?
* Example: `dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i]`

4. **Choose a Method:**

* **Top-Down (Memoization)**: Write a recursive function and cache results.
* **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**: Fill a DP table iteratively.
* **Space Optimization**: Use variables instead of a full array if only a few past states are needed.

5. **Implement & Test:**

* Start with simple inputs and edge cases.
* Compare your DP solution with brute-force for validation.

#  Common 1D DP Problem Formats

| Problem Type                           | Description                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fibonacci Variants**                 | Build up using previous values (`f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`)                |
| **Climbing Stairs**                    | Count the number of ways to reach the top with 1 or 2 steps              |
| **Min/Max Cost**                       | Find minimum or maximum cost to reach a position or achieve a goal       |
| **Partition Problems**                 | Decide whether a subset of elements can satisfy a constraint (sum, diff) |
| **Knapsack Variants (0/1, unbounded)** | Choose items with/without repetition to maximize/minimize a quantity     |
| **House Robber**                       | Pick non-adjacent elements for max sum                                   |
| **Jump Game**                          | Check if the end of the array is reachable with variable-length jumps    |


#  Tips for Mastering DP

*  **Recursion First:** Always try solving recursively before optimizing.
*  **Visualize the DP Array/Table:** Helps debug and understand transitions.
*  **Practice Common Patterns:** Count ways, max/min path, subset sum, etc.
*  **Talk It Out or Write Down Transitions:** Articulating the recurrence helps.
